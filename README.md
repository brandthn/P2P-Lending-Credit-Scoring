# ðŸ“Š P2P Lending Predictive Modelling

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **P2P Lending Predictive Modelling** project! This initiative focuses on predicting credit risk in peer-to-peer lending using advanced machine learning techniques. Our goal is to analyze borrower solvency and enhance traditional credit scoring methods by incorporating economic indicators for a more comprehensive assessment.

## Objectives
- **Identify Influential Factors**: Analyze key borrower and loan characteristics that impact loan performance.
- **Develop Predictive Models**: Construct models that outperform traditional credit scoring methods in accuracy and adaptability.
- **Integrate Economic Indicators** __(Ongoing, not fully released)__ : Evaluate how economic indicators can be integrated to offer a more dynamic and holistic assessment of credit risk.
